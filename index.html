									<h2>International Layoff Tracker</h2>
									<p>This is a dashboard that tracks layoffs from March 11, 2020 to April 28, 2023. Tech companies show the biggest layoffs among companies while rounds of layoffs appear in the finance industry. Some companies from certain countries are not in the data due to geographic restrictions. Context filtering and parameters were used to show into different aspects of the data.</p>

									<h2>Housing Data Cleaning with SQL</h2>
									<p>This is an SQL script of data cleaning on Housing data in Tennessee. A major challenge was determining which data was necessary to keep and figuring out how to remove nested whitespaces in strings. The data cleaning consisted of formating dates, parsing addresses into more usable columns, filling in missing data and removing extra whitespace nested in the strings.</p>

									<h2>Netflix Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
									<p>This is a Jupyter Notebook of Netflix data that showed 2019 as the highest acquisition of media content for the platform. A challenge was determining the right visuals and functions needed to ensure the numbers were accurate to the platform's history. Data was prepared, cleaned, and manipulated to deep dive into the quantity of media acquired through the years. With more time, a random forest model would be used to classify what should be watched based on prior viewing experience.</p>

A challenge was using the right formulas to summarize bike purchases. Pivot tables and charts were used to construct the dashboard for bike sales.</p>

									<h3>Web Scrapping Stock Prices</h3>
									<p>In this Jupyter Notebook are stock prices from a retail company. The data needed to be collected for three months from Yahoo Finance and organized into a .csv file for easier access. BeautifulSoup was used to parse and preprocess the data for manipulation, and datetime was used to create a automated function to extract stock prices daily. If given more time, three months of data would have been captured to get a more robust dataset and view of the stock prices.</p>

									<span class="icon solid major fa-play-circle"></span>
									<h3>Recommendation System</h3>
									<p>This is a Jupyter Notebook of Japanese media dataset. A content-based filtering method was used to make suggestions on the content to watch based on similar tags. The data needed to be preprocessed and cleaned of nulls, as well as imputated, before being analyzed for the system. Tokenization was used to make separate tag words, so that they could be vectorized. Cosine similarity was applied to the tags to find the tags nearest to each another. If given more time, an application would have been created to make the system more user friendly.</p>

									<h3>Ecommerce Regression Model</h3>
									<p>For this Jupyter Notebook, an ecommerce dataset was analyzed to see which feature had the most profitable association with the total amount spent by customers. The data needed to be explored for all potential relationships and distributions to then train the data on the Linear Regression model, and an interpretation had to be made based on the metrics the model produced. If allowed more time, a further look into potential association with other features would have been done, based on the findings uncovered during exploratory data analysis. </p>

									<h3>Medical Appointments</h3>
									<p>This is am SQL script of stored procedures to answer questions on a medical appointment database. A challenge of this project was creating the relational database to ensure the keys connected and constraints were implemented to maintain database security. Use of data definition and data manipulation language helped with constructing the tables and transforming the data. If given more time, each table in the relational database would be expanded with more records.</p>
